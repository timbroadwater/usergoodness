				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p>Our mission at User Goodness is all about delivering data-driven insights (design) to strengthen the partnership between nonprofits and the communities that they serve. We do this through a simple conversation to get to know you and your business goals and see if we might work well together. So, if your nonprofit has not quite achieved the status of ultimate perfection (fun/topical phrase that means “ultimate perfection”), then please read on…</p>
				<p>Our research design development and content team has some wicked good skills with a combined (number) years of work experience in the study and practical application of user experience. (type of industry) We’ve been around the block, or rather the industry, and have equipped ourselves nicely with tools and methods to tackle any curveball you might throw at us.</p>
				<h2>If you’re not convinced just yet, check out our core values!</h2>
